Create an implementation plan for the tasks outlined in `research.md` in the repository root. Make sure to read the full file and consider all relationships
and possible gotchas.

Make sure the plan involves writing tests for the new functionality and executing the tests.

Last step of the plan should be to remove the research.md file from the repository after succesfull implementation.
